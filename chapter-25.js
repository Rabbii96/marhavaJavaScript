//JavaScript code is parsed and compiled by the JavaScript engine (like V8) into bytecode. Then, it is executed line-by-line during runtime using an interpreter or JIT compilati
//The V8 engine is a high-performance JavaScript engine developed by Google. Its main purpose is to parse, compile, and execute JavaScript code efficiently inside browsers.
//Compiling JavaScript code during execution (not before) into machine code.Then It optimizes frequently used code for faster performance by monitoring and re-compiling "hot" code paths on the fly.
